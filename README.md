# paxos

Implement multi paxos in Rust . It is just a prototype intending to learn and internalize the algorithm, not meant to substitute perfectly competent libraries out there. This [paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/Paxos/paxos.pdf) is used heavily for inspiration and is the primary source.

Features:
* basic algorithm
* state reduction

Planned: 
* support on TCP network
* failure detection
* Use Colocation
